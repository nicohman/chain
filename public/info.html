			<div class="large-label"> About Demenses</div>
			<div class="label-content">Demenses is a social network that focuses upon the content more than the users, thereby eliminating in large part the worst part of most social networks: people. Now, you can browse memes and news without anybody messaging, pestering, or friending you! It is designed to be a federated system with no single server, but that will be released when I am sure it will be secure. You can view the code at its <a href="https://www.github.com/nicohman/chain">github</a></div>
			<div class="large-label">Owner</div>
			<div class="label-content">nicohman. Report all bugs via <a href="https://www.github.com/nicohman">github</a>.</div>
			<div class="large-label">Rules</div>
			<div class="label-content">On Demenses, there is one major rule, from which all lesser rules are derived from: <strong>Don't be a dick.</strong>.
				Pre-banned groups:
				<ul>
					<li>Russian government employees</li>
					<li>Donald Trump or a derivative thereof</li>
					<li>Mike Pence</li>
					<li>Child molester(s)</li>
					<li>Westboro Baptist Church<li>
					<li>Most violent criminals<li>
					<li> If you consistently hit a ratio of 0.6 objectively bad posts, I might ban you. </li>
					<li>Under 13? That's a preban!</li>
				</ul> Again, any dickishness can get you banned if I see it fit, so these are not exclusive. To report those posting content which violates the One True Rule, you can <a href="mailto:nico.hickman@gmail.com">email me</a></div>
